Hey MCI. There seems to be a lot of misinformation being spread about
how to keep yourself safe during the pandemic. To combat this, the
journalists at *The Bacon* have talked to experts in the field to bring
you the most reliable advice to protect yourself from the novel
coronavirus. Here are our top tips:

**Drink water:** Viruses are very bad at swimming and will drown if you
drink enough water.

**Set boundaries:** Say, “Stop. I don’t feel comfortable with you taking
over my cells. Please respect my personal space.” The virus will be
shocked by your level of maturity and will back down.

**Throw your wallet in front of you and run in the opposite direction:**
The virus will go for your wallet and leave you alone.

**Use street smarts:** When face-to-face with the virus, chew a tab of
alka-seltzer. This creates a foaming-at-the-mouth appearance that makes
it look like you have rabies. This will throw the virus off its rhythm.
It won’t know how to fight back.

**Make fun of it:** We here at *The Bacon* are not fans of bullying, but
desperate times call for desperate measures. Say, “Who do you think you
are? You don’t even have cells. You’re only able to reproduce by
leeching off others. How pathetic. Are you even alive?” This will send
the virus into an existential crisis. It will cry. Use this time to make
your escape.

**Become TikTok famous:** It will be intimidated by your virality and
won’t try to compete.

This is the most up-to-date information we have now. We hope you have
learned something useful. Please continue to listen to health
professionals and follow the guidelines set by your federal and
provincial governments. Stay safe Bears.
